### Fonts
The Monserrat and Open Sans font pairing was carefully selected for our website project to create a visually harmonious and engaging user experience.

Monserrat, with its clean lines, geometric shapes, and versatile letterforms, exudes a modern and professional vibe. Its balanced proportions and distinct readability make it an excellent choice for both headlines and body text.

Complementing Monserrat, we opted for Open Sans as a versatile sans-serif font. Open Sans offers excellent legibility across different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless reading experience for our users. Its friendly curves and open letterforms add a touch of warmth and approachability to the overall design. The extensive font weights and styles available within the Open Sans family provide us with ample flexibility to emphasize important information and create visual contrast.

### Color Scheme & Accessibility
For the Collabra website, we carefully curated a color scheme that strikes a balance between seriousness and playfulness, reflecting trust, positive metrics, and flexibility. The color gamma comprises the following key colors:

- **Background**: `#262626`
- **Foreground**: `#fafafa`
- **Accent**: `#62d6ab`

Every color in the Collabra color scheme has been meticulously checked for contrast, ensuring accessibility for all users.

The dark background (#262626) provides a sense of stability and sophistication, while the light foreground color (#fafafa) ensures optimal readability and contrast.

By prioritizing accessibility and employing contrast-checked colors, the Collabra website achieves both a visually appealing design and a user-friendly experience for all visitors.
