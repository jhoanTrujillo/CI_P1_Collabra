### Color Scheme & Accessibility
For the Collabra website, a color scheme was carefully chosen to strike a balance between seriousness and playfulness, reflecting trust, positive metrics, and flexibility. The color gamma consists of the following key colors:

Background: #262626
Foreground: #fafafa
Accent 1: #D6D0FB
Accent 2: #9DE1C8
All colors in the Collabra color scheme have been carefully checked for contrast to ensure accessibility for all users.

The choice of a dark background (#262626) provides a sense of stability and sophistication, while the light foreground color (#fafafa) ensures readability and contrast.

Accent color #D6D0FB is employed to convey trust and reliability, serving as a prominent color for important elements throughout the website. This color choice fosters a professional and serious atmosphere.

Additionally, accent color #9DE1C8 adds a touch of playfulness and flexibility to the color scheme. It injects a vibrant and refreshing feel, harmonizing with the overall design while reflecting positive metrics and adaptability.

By considering accessibility and using contrast-checked colors, the Collabra website achieves both a visually appealing design and a user-friendly experience for all visitors.
