## Design Principels 
These are the design principels that guide the design choices for Collabra:

1. **Simplicity and User-Friendliness:** The Collabra website embraces a clean and intuitive design, ensuring ease of navigation and a user-friendly experience for visitors.
2. **Clear Communication:** The website prioritizes clear and concise communication to convey information effectively. Content is presented in a straightforward manner, enabling visitors to easily understand the services offered and the value proposition of Collabra.

### Fonts
The Monserrat and Open Sans font pairing was carefully selected for our website project to create a visually harmonious and engaging user experience.

Monserrat, with its clean lines, geometric shapes, and versatile letterforms, exudes a modern and professional vibe. Its balanced proportions and distinct readability make it an excellent choice for both headlines and body text.

Complementing Monserrat, we opted for Open Sans as a versatile sans-serif font. Open Sans offers excellent legibility across different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless reading experience for our users. Its friendly curves and open letterforms add a touch of warmth and approachability to the overall design. The extensive font weights and styles available within the Open Sans family provide us with ample flexibility to emphasize important information and create visual contrast.

### Color Scheme & Accessibility
For the Collabra website, a color scheme was carefully chosen to strike a balance between seriousness and playfulness, reflecting trust, positive metrics, and flexibility. The color gamma consists of the following key colors:

Background: #262626
Foreground: #fafafa
Accent 1: #D6D0FB
Accent 2: #9DE1C8
All colors in the Collabra color scheme have been carefully checked for contrast to ensure accessibility for all users.

The choice of a dark background (#262626) provides a sense of stability and sophistication, while the light foreground color (#fafafa) ensures readability and contrast.

Accent color #D6D0FB is employed to convey trust and reliability, serving as a prominent color for important elements throughout the website. This color choice fosters a professional and serious atmosphere.

Additionally, accent color #9DE1C8 adds a touch of playfulness and flexibility to the color scheme. It injects a vibrant and refreshing feel, harmonizing with the overall design while reflecting positive metrics and adaptability.

By considering accessibility and using contrast-checked colors, the Collabra website achieves both a visually appealing design and a user-friendly experience for all visitors.
